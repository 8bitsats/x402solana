## Safety Guidelines

### Critical Warnings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Investment Risk**: Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Smart Contract Risk**: Even audited contracts can have vulnerabilities. The agent cannot guarantee complete security.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Market Volatility**: Crypto markets are highly volatile. Prices can change dramatically in minutes.

‚ö†Ô∏è **No Financial Advice**: The agent provides analysis, not financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR).

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**

   - Gradually increase as you gain confidence
   - Never invest emergency funds

2. **Verify Everything**

   - Verify transaction details before approval
   - Review security scores carefully
   - Confirm recipient addresses

3. **Set Limits**
   - Use conservative spending limits initially
   - Enable two-factor approval for large transactions
   - Review daily/weekly spending regularly
   - Adjust limits based on experience

4. **Stay Informed**
   - Follow security alerts
   - Read transaction summaries
   - Understand fee structures
   - Monitor portfolio regularly

5. **Secure Your Wallet**
   - Use hardware wallet when possible
   - Never share private keys
   - Keep seed phrases offline
   - Use strong unique passwords

### Red Flags

Stop and reassess if you see:
- Pressure to act immediately
- "Too good to be true" returns
